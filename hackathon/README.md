# Hackathon Developer Resources and Info

## Pro Tips for a Successful Hackathon

- Need some help? You can find a team HERE.
- The hackathon has a hard cutoff date/time, so if it looks like you might miss it, submit your project early. You can always update it after you submit it!
- The presentation is SUPER important, whether it be a video or a slide deck. Each hackathon has a ton of submissions, and not all projects will have the chance to make it to the code review stage. Make sure your presentation is compelling enough to grab the judges and make it to the next round.
- Create a Twitter account early, and start sharing your project and updates to garner early community support
- Create milestones for yourself. Plan out specific dates you want to have certain things done and try to stick to close to this as possible. The worst thing you can do is come in with no plan.
- Start following Solana devs and community members from your Twitter account. A good start is following this LIST.
